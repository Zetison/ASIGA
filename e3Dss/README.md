# Exact 3D scattering solutions
Exact 3D scattering solutions for spherical symmetric scatterers computes the solution to scattering problems on multilayered spherical (elastic) shells impinged by a plane wave or a wave due to a point source. The code is written in MATLAB and may for that reason be improved compuationally.

Many options are available, type "help e3Dss" for more information.

It is recomended to build upon examples in the examples folder. In particular, a minimal example is given in examples/theDefaultExample.m
